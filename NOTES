# Modularized pipeline

    Pipeline tasks can be grouped together, e.g.

        astromatic preset:
            generate config -> run -> convert output

# flexible input, output for astromatic

    inputs could be catalogs, or refcat, or any other parameters

# DRMAA dispatcher for scripts

    If task is running though subprocess, it also could be dispatched
    to cluster resources via DRMAA

# callable functions module
# config file refractor

    define input, per_input_extra, extra

    > .. init: create the sym links -> generate parameter file


# specifications of describing a task

    use a single dict
    close to nature language:

    keys:
        name, func, type_, in_, out_

    inputs could be
        taskdict | task | glob, or tuple up with regex string
    add_inputs could be task

    out could be
        fmt string | string

    astromatic tools
        in_ each in should have an inkey
        out each out should have an outkey
        dump configuration is automatically generated as an additional step
